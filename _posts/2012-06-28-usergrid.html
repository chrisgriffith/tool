Apigee Usergrid is a highly-scalable data platform for mobile applications. It lets you quickly create a rich user model, create activity streams, enable status updates, location-based check-ins, comments, or any other activity to be broadcast to fellow users. It's all accessible through a RESTful JSON API that's a breeze to use from PhoneGap.
