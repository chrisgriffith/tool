JayData is a standards-based, cross-platform Javascript library and a set of practices to access and manipulate data from various cloud services (OData, YQL, Facebook) and local storages (SQLite, IndexedDB). As JayData implements the JavaScript Language Query concept, you can use the same syntax to perform CRUD operations with each data provider.
Using JavaScript library you can create enterprise-grade data centric, HTML5/hybrid applications.
