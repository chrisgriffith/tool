The MDS plugin extends the Android Development Tools (ADT) and Eclipse JSDT. It includes a project wizard to configure PhoneGap projects, enabling app development and deployment in a few clicks. The wizard offers options to include the jQuery Mobile and Sencha Touch UI frameworks. The editor includes configurable JSLint/JSHint to give real-time feedback on JavaScript typos and style. The included PhoneGap API demo source rapidly gets you up to speed.
