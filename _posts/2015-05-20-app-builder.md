Create cross-platform HTML5 apps without programming knowledge. Based on AngularJS, Bootstrap CSS and Cordova, App Builder allow non programmers to build their own HTMl5 apps in a visual way and prepare the apps behaviour using "actions" which can be edited also in a visual way. Programmers and more advanced users can also get beneficts using App Builder, since pure Javascript and CSS code are also possible to use.
