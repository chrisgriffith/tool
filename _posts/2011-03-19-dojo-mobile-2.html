Dojo Mobile is rapidly evolving with a variety of great user interface elements, interactions, and convenient APIs.

User interface widgets include buttons, edge to edge lists, flippable views, icon containers, menus, progress indicators, scrollable views, side by side layouts, toggle buttons, tab bars, and much more. Support is in place for iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android themes, and in progress for Blackberry 6, WebOS, and neutral themes. CSS3 animations and transition effects are supported
