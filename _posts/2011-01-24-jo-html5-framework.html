Jo is a small HTML5 app framework designed to run on top of PhoneGap. Jo comes to the party with common mobile UI widgets and is completely customizable with CSS3. This open source project is well documented and supported. Jo works with PhoneGap, most mobile browsers, desktop browsers and even Dashboard widgets (see the demo video).
