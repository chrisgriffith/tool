Zepto.js is a minimalist framework for mobile WebKit browsers, with a jQuery-compatible chaining syntax.
100% jQuery coverage is not a design goal, however all APIs provided match their jQuery counterparts.
The ultimate goal is to have a ~5k library that handles most basic dredge work for you in a nice API so you can concentrate on getting stuff done.
