Pilot is Emitrom's Java binding for PhoneGap (Apache Cordova), but it also includes support for other APIs such as Google Maps and Google WebFontLoader.  The library is licensed under the Apache 2 license, so it is free for commercial use.  Pilot can be used in conjunction with other GWT-based libraries such as Touch4j or Lienzo.
